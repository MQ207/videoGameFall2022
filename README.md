# AimBot game

Play a simple game but with aimbot

## Description

My game was made during my Bellarmine programming class with the help of Mr. Cozort and my fellow classmates. This game is just a normally platformer with no sprites  (Yet) and no sound (also coming). I hope this game satifies your desire to hit ever shot without having to aim like playing Moira in Overwatch.
